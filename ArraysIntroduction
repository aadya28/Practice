Introduction to Arrays and ArrayList

Syntax for declaration of an Array.
datatype[] var_name = new datatype[size];

For example to define an array of 5 roll numbers
int[] rollNos = new int[5]; or
int[] rollNos2 = {1,2,3,4,5};
int[] ros Declaration : ros is getting defined in the stack.
This happens at compile time.

ros = new int[5] Initialisation : here is the object being created in the memory (heap)
This happens at runtime.(Dynamic memory allocation)

Null is a special literal that is the default value of any declared variable.
